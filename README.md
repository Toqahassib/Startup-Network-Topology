# Startup-Network-Topology

Security for network infrastructure is intended to provide sophisticated and diversified resources for defending against internal and external attacks. Each of these essential components—hardware, software, and services—may have flaws that might be exploited by malicious or inadvertent activities. Infrastructures can be harmed by denial-of-service attacks, illegal access, spam, malware, etc. Although external assaults are the most common source of these risks, network security solutions should also include internal vulnerabilities. Deletion, alteration, data leakage, unintentional downloads of harmful information, and unlawful acts are just a few examples. In this project, I revised a finance advisory startup’s (myFinTech) current network infrastructure so that remote users get uninterrupted access to the network and system resources hosted at the main data center in the company’s Headquarter (HQ). As a result, in the report, I came up with a plan to upgrade the network to accommodate the new requirements and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of the systems.
